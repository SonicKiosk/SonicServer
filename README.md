## joe branch
im sneakily forcefully shoving this into the readme because i dont think its clear enough that theres another branch being maintained by me
theres another branch (this is rewrite-to-not-be-shti) called `joe` that i am maintaining seperately and independantly.
i did this because i didnt necessarily agree with some of the choices planned for this branch and i enjoyed working on this so i decided to make my own seperate little thing.
anyone else working on this project isnt hitler or nun or wanted to ruin it i just have my development preferences and wish to keep the things ive done the way they are for my sake
